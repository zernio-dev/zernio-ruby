# Zernio::FacebookPostEarningsResponseMetricsValue

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **total** | **Float** | Lifetime earnings in \&quot;unit\&quot;, exactly as Meta returned them. Never rescaled. | [optional] |
| **unit** | **String** | \&quot;micro_amount\&quot;: Meta returned an object shape carrying a micro amount, and \&quot;total\&quot; is that integer, unconverted. Zernio does not publish a divisor because Meta does not document one; divide by the scale you have verified against the Page&#39;s own Meta Business Suite export. This is always content_monetization_earnings.  \&quot;unspecified\&quot;: Meta returned a bare number with no unit metadata, passed through as-is; Meta does not state whether it is major or minor currency units. This is always monetization_approximate_earnings.  | [optional] |
| **currency** | **String** | ISO 4217 currency, or null when Meta omitted it. Always null on monetization_approximate_earnings; always present on content_monetization_earnings.  | [optional] |

## Example

```ruby
require 'zernio-sdk'

instance = Zernio::FacebookPostEarningsResponseMetricsValue.new(
  total: null,
  unit: null,
  currency: USD
)
```
