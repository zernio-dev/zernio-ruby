| **account_id** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **video_id** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **language** | **String** | The language of the returned track. | [optional] |
| **track_id** | **String** | YouTube&#39;s own caption track id. | [optional] |
| **track_kind** | **String** | &#x60;asr&#x60; is YouTube&#39;s auto-generated track; &#x60;standard&#x60; was uploaded by the channel. | [optional] |
| **source** | **String** | &#x60;cache&#x60; when served from our stored copy, &#x60;youtube&#x60; when this call spent the quota units. | [optional] |
| **fetched_at** | **Time** | When the stored copy was downloaded from YouTube. | [optional] |
| **text** | **String** | The whole transcript as one paragraph, no timings. | [optional] |
| **cues** | [**Array&lt;GetYoutubeCaptions200ResponseCuesInner&gt;**](GetYoutubeCaptions200ResponseCuesInner.md) | Timed cues. Present when format is json. Auto-generated cues overlap in time by design (captions roll), so &#x60;start&#x60; can precede the previous cue&#39;s &#x60;end&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **srt** | **String** | Raw SubRip body. Present when format is srt. | [optional] |
| **available_tracks** | [**Array&lt;GetYoutubeCaptions200ResponseAvailableTracksInner&gt;**](GetYoutubeCaptions200ResponseAvailableTracksInner.md) | Every track on the video, so you can re-request another language. On a cached read this is the listing as it stood when we downloaded, so a language added to the video since then appears only after a &#x60;refresh&#x3D;true&#x60; or when you request that language directly. | [optional] |
