# Zernio::UpdateAdRequestTargeting

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **keywords** | [**Array&lt;UpdateAdRequestTargetingKeywordsInner&gt;**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingKeywordsInner.md) | Google only. The FULL desired set of positive keywords for the entire ad group. Omit to leave positives unchanged; [] removes all positives. Negatives are independent. Entries are strings (BROAD) or { text, matchType } with matchType exact | phrase | broad; an omitted matchType also defaults to BROAD. Matching case-insensitive text AND match type retains the existing criterion ID, status, bid overrides, labels and history without a mutation. A changed text or match type uses remove/create, without transferring the old criterion&#39;s attributes or history. See Google keyword replacement above for an EXACT-to-BROAD example. Mirrored to GET /v1/ads/keywords immediately.  | [optional] |
| **negative_keywords** | [**Array&lt;UpdateAdRequestTargetingKeywordsInner&gt;**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingKeywordsInner.md) | Google only. The FULL desired set of negative keywords for the entire ad group, independent of positives. Omit to leave negatives unchanged; [] removes all negatives. Uses the same text/match-type identity and preservation contract as keywords above. Strings and objects without matchType default to BROAD, so resending an EXACT or PHRASE negative as a bare string requests a different criterion. Campaign negatives are separate: use /v1/ads/campaigns/{campaignId}/negative-keywords to manage those.  | [optional] |
| **devices** | [**Array&lt;UpdateAdRequestTargetingDevicesInner&gt;**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingDevicesInner.md) | Google only. The FULL new set of device bid modifiers for the campaign. Entries are a device name alone (targeted, bid modifier reset to 1) or { device, bidModifier }. A supported device you leave out is switched off, written as a bid modifier of 0. Google never removes a device criterion, so an excluded device reads back as bidModifier 0 rather than disappearing, and a set that switches every device off returns 422. Which devices a campaign carries depends on its channel: Search campaigns have MOBILE, DESKTOP and TABLET, Display campaigns also have CONNECTED_TV, and sending a device the campaign does not carry returns 422. | [optional] |
| **age_min** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **age_max** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **countries** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. On Google this is the FULL new country set for the campaign (same contract as &#x60;locations&#x60;); on LinkedIn it replaces the campaign&#39;s geo criteria. | [optional] |
| **locations** | [**UpdateAdRequestTargetingLocations**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingLocations.md) |  | [optional] |
| **languages** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Google only. The FULL new language set for the campaign, as Google language codes (ISO 639-1, plus variants such as &#x60;zh_CN&#x60;). An unknown code returns 400. | [optional] |
| **interests** | [**Array&lt;UpdateAdRequestTargetingInterestsInner&gt;**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingInterestsInner.md) | Interest objects from /v1/ads/interests. Each must include id and name. | [optional] |
| **advantage_audience** | **Integer** | Meta only. Omit to preserve the existing setting on update. 0 &#x3D; disabled, 1 &#x3D; enabled. | [optional] |
