# Zernio::SelectGoogleBusinessLocationRequest

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **profile_id** | **String** | Profile ID from your connection flow |  |
| **location_id** | **String** | The Google Business Profile location ID selected by the user. Send this or locations, not both. | [optional] |
| **locations** | [**Array&lt;SelectGoogleBusinessLocationRequestLocationsInner&gt;**](SelectGoogleBusinessLocationRequestLocationsInner.md) | Several locations to connect from one sign-in, each as its own account. The sign-in is used once for the whole batch and handed back only if none connected. With two or more distinct locations the response lists &#x60;accounts&#x60; and &#x60;failed&#x60; instead of &#x60;account&#x60;, and the request is refused with 400 on a reconnect. A single location behaves exactly like locationId. | [optional] |
| **account_id** | **String** | Optional but recommended. The Google Business Profile Account resource name (\&quot;accounts/123\&quot;) that owns the selected location (returned per-location by GET /v1/connect/googlebusiness/locations). When provided, the location is resolved directly instead of by enumerating the account, which is required for accounts that own many locations. Omit only for small accounts.  | [optional] |
| **pending_data_token** | **String** | Token from the OAuth callback redirect (pendingDataToken query param). Tokens and profile data are retrieved server-side from this token. |  |
| **redirect_url** | **String** | Optional custom redirect URL to return to after selection | [optional] |
