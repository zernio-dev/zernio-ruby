# Zernio::AdDailyMetrics

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **spend** | **Float** |  | [optional] |
| **impressions** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **reach** | **Integer** | Unique people reached in the requested date range. Meta (facebook/instagram) and TikTok: the platform&#39;s own de-duplicated reach for the exact range, fetched live and cached up to ~1 hour (may lag recent delivery; on a transient platform error the value temporarily falls back to a sum of per-day reach, which overcounts people reached on multiple days or by multiple child ads). Because it is de-duplicated, reach is NOT additive on these platforms: neither daily values nor child nodes sum to the range total. Google, LinkedIn, X, Pinterest and OpenAI report 0 (reach not synced). Frequency (impressions / reach) is only meaningful for Meta and TikTok. | [optional] |
| **clicks** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **ctr** | **Float** | Click-through rate (%) | [optional] |
| **cpc** | **Float** | Cost per click | [optional] |
| **cpm** | **Float** | Cost per 1000 impressions | [optional] |
| **engagement** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **conversions** | **Float** | Count of conversion events over the requested date range. FRACTIONAL: attribution splits one conversion across touchpoints and Google additionally reports modeled conversions, so values like 0.347 are normal. Meta: events matching the campaign&#39;s promoted_object.custom_event_type (PURCHASE, LEAD, etc.). Google: the account&#39;s tracked conversions. X and LinkedIn: their reported website/lead conversions (added 2026-07). 0 for non-conversion campaigns or when no events have fired. | [optional] |
| **cost_per_conversion** | **Float** | Derived spend / conversions in the same currency as spend. 0 when conversions is 0. | [optional] |
| **actions** | **Hash&lt;String, Integer&gt;** | Per-action-type counts summed over the date range, keyed by the platform&#39;s action-type names. Meta: raw Insights action_type keys (link_click, offsite_conversion.fb_pixel_purchase, onsite_conversion.lead_grouped, ...) — both engagement and conversion events. X: conversion types (purchase, sign_up, site_visit, download, custom). LinkedIn: conversion types (post_click, post_view, lead_gen). Google returns {} (its per-action names aren&#39;t synced per ad). Empty object when no actions are reported. NOTE: keys differ by platform, so branch on the ad&#39;s platform when interpreting them. | [optional] |
| **action_values** | **Hash&lt;String, Float&gt;** | Monetary mirror of &#x60;actions&#x60;, from Meta&#39;s Insights &#x60;action_values[]&#x60; array. Same keying — values are the revenue attributed to each action_type, in ad-account native currency (same unit as &#x60;spend&#x60;; see the campaign node&#39;s &#x60;currency&#x60; field). Use this to compute revenue-per-event (e.g. avg purchase value). Meta-only; other platforms return {}. | [optional] |
| **purchase_value** | **Float** | Convenience sum of purchase-type action values — picked from &#x60;actionValues&#x60; via the same priority list as &#x60;conversions&#x60; so both fields describe the same events. In ad-account native currency. 0 when the campaign has no purchase event configured. Meta-only. | [optional] |
| **roas** | **Float** | Return on ad spend — derived as &#x60;purchaseValue / spend&#x60;. 0 when &#x60;spend&#x60; is 0. Equivalent to Meta&#39;s &#x60;purchase_roas&#x60; under default attribution. At ad-set and campaign levels this is recomputed from summed purchaseValue + spend (NOT averaged across children) so it&#39;s mathematically correct at every rollup level. | [optional] |
| **cost_per_action** | **Hash&lt;String, Float&gt;** | Derived &#x60;spend / actions[type]&#x60; for every action type with a non-zero count, in ad-account native currency. Same keys as &#x60;actions&#x60;. Rounded to 4 decimals because cheap actions cost well under a cent. Recomputed from summed spend + counts at every rollup level. Empty object when spend is 0 or no actions are reported. | [optional] |
| **outbound_clicks** | **Integer** | Clicks leading off Meta&#39;s surfaces to the advertiser&#39;s destination. Meta-only; other platforms report 0. | [optional] |
| **outbound_clicks_ctr** | **Float** | Derived &#x60;outboundClicks / impressions * 100&#x60;, recomputed from sums at every rollup level. | [optional] |
| **inline_link_clicks** | **Integer** | In-session link clicks. Differs from the attributed &#x60;link_click&#x60; count in &#x60;actions&#x60;/&#x60;engagementBreakdown.linkClicks&#x60;, which uses the attribution window. Meta-only. | [optional] |
| **inline_link_click_ctr** | **Float** | Derived &#x60;inlineLinkClicks / impressions * 100&#x60;, recomputed from sums at every rollup level. | [optional] |
| **unique_clicks** | **Integer** | People who clicked at least once. NOT additive: summed across days/children it overcounts people who clicked on multiple days or ads, so treat rollups as an upper bound (same caveat as &#x60;reach&#x60;). Meta-only. | [optional] |
| **unique_ctr** | **Float** | Derived &#x60;uniqueClicks / impressions * 100&#x60; (NOT Meta&#39;s reach-based unique_ctr). Inherits the non-additivity caveat of &#x60;uniqueClicks&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video_play_actions** | **Integer** | Number of times the video started playing, summed over the date range and across children at ad-set/campaign level. 0 for non-video ads. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_play_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;video_play_actions&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video30_sec_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views of at least 30 seconds (or to the end, for shorter videos). Sources: Meta &#x60;video_30_sec_watched_actions&#x60; (Meta only). | [optional] |
| **video_thruplay_watched_actions** | **Integer** | ThruPlays (watched to completion, or at least 15 seconds). Sources: Meta &#x60;video_thruplay_watched_actions&#x60; (Meta only). | [optional] |
| **video_p25_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views reaching 25% of the video&#39;s length. With the other percentile fields, powers hook/hold/drop-off analysis (e.g. hook rate &#x3D; videoP25WatchedActions / videoPlayActions). Sources: Meta &#x60;video_p25_watched_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;video_views_p25&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video_p50_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views reaching 50% of the video&#39;s length. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_p50_watched_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;video_views_p50&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video_p75_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views reaching 75% of the video&#39;s length. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_p75_watched_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;video_views_p75&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video_p95_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views reaching 95% of the video&#39;s length. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_p95_watched_actions&#x60; (Meta only). | [optional] |
| **video_p100_watched_actions** | **Integer** | Views reaching 100% of the video&#39;s length. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_p100_watched_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;video_views_p100&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **video_avg_time_watched_actions** | **Float** | Average seconds watched per play. Aggregated over date ranges and across children as a play-weighted average (total watch time / total plays), never a plain average of averages. Sources: Meta &#x60;video_avg_time_watched_actions&#x60;, TikTok &#x60;average_video_play&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **cost_per_thruplay** | **Float** | Derived &#x60;spend / videoThruplayWatchedActions&#x60;, in ad-account native currency. Rounded to 4 decimals rather than the usual 2 because a ThruPlay routinely costs well under a cent. 0 when the ad has no ThruPlays (ThruPlay is Meta-only). | [optional] |
| **funnel** | [**AdFunnelCounts**](AdFunnelCounts.md) |  | [optional] |
| **engagement_breakdown** | [**AdEngagementCounts**](AdEngagementCounts.md) |  | [optional] |
| **last_synced_at** | **Time** | Present on individual ads only, not on campaign aggregations | [optional] |
| **date** | **Date** | Calendar day (YYYY-MM-DD) these metrics apply to. | [optional] |
