# Zernio::ExternalPostMediaItem

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **type** | **String** |  |  |
| **url** | **String** | &#39;Direct URL to the media file. Null when the platform withholds it: check mediaStatus before downloading. Instagram omits the video file for Reels it flags as containing copyrighted material (its docs name audio as the usual cause), so type stays \&quot;video\&quot; while the file is permanently unreachable.&#39; |  |
| **thumbnail** | **String** | Cover image. Still present when url is null. | [optional] |
| **media_status** | **String** | Present only when the media file could not be retrieved. Absent means the file is available at url. | [optional] |
| **unavailable_reason** | **String** | Why the file is missing. platform_withheld means the platform declined to return it and retrying will not help. | [optional] |

## Example

require 'zernio-sdk'

instance = Zernio::ExternalPostMediaItem.new(
