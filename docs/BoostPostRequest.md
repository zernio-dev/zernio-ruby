# Zernio::BoostPostRequest

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **creative_features** | **Hash&lt;String, String&gt;** | Meta Advantage+ creative enhancements. Map snake_case feature names to OPT_IN or OPT_OUT; Meta validates supported keys and unspecified features default to OPT_OUT. auto_promotion_tag is an Advantage+ enhancement, not the Ads Manager Promotion setting. The deprecated standard_enhancements bundle is rejected by Meta. | [optional] |
| **post_id** | **String** | Zernio post ID (provide this or platformPostId) | [optional] |
| **platform_post_id** | **String** | Platform post ID (alternative to postId). Meta: a Page post id (&#x60;&lt;pageId&gt;_&lt;postId&gt;&#x60; or the bare post id) or an Instagram media id. On a Meta Ads business-login connection (platform metaads) the id is resolved live: an Instagram media id is boosted as that media, running as the Instagram account that owns it. | [optional] |
| **account_id** | **String** | Zernio account id. Normally the connected posting account (facebook, instagram, tiktok, linkedin, pinterest, twitter) or a googleads account. TikTok: the TikTok Ads connection (platform tiktokads) is accepted too when the post brings its own authorization (sparkAuthCode or sparkPosts), so Spark ads need no organic TikTok account connected; such a call must use platformPostId, not postId. |  |
| **ad_account_id** | **String** | Platform ad account ID |  |
| **name** | **String** |  |  |
| **campaign_name** | **String** | Exact name for the campaign this boost provisions. Omitted keeps the default &#x60;&lt;name&gt; - Campaign&#x60;. Every platform: on LinkedIn it names the campaign group. Ignored on the Meta attach shape (&#x60;adSetId&#x60;), which creates no campaign. | [optional] |
| **ad_set_name** | **String** | Exact name for the ad-group level this boost provisions. Omitted keeps the default &#x60;&lt;name&gt; - Ad Group&#x60;. Meta: ad set; TikTok, Pinterest, Google: ad group; X: line item; LinkedIn: the campaign under the campaign group. Ignored on the Meta attach shape. | [optional] |
| **goal** | **String** | Available goals vary by platform. Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and TikTok support all 7. LinkedIn supports all except app_promotion. X supports engagement, traffic, awareness, video_views, app_promotion. Pinterest and Google Ads support only engagement, traffic, awareness, video_views. |  |
| **ad_set_id** | **String** | Meta, or TikTok with &#x60;smartPlus: true&#x60;. Attach the boosted post to this existing ad set instead of creating a campaign. On TikTok the id is an existing Smart+ ad group: the post is added as one more Spark ad in it (up to 30 per ad group), under the identity its &#x60;sparkAuthCode&#x60; creates; goal and budget are inherited from the Smart+ campaign; a regular ad group is rejected with a 400. Meta: The ad set then owns budget, schedule and targeting; sending those too is a 400. | [optional] |
| **existing_campaign_id** | **String** | TikTok only. Create the ad group and the Spark ad under this existing TikTok campaign instead of creating a new campaign. The campaign keeps its own status and objective (the objective must fit &#x60;goal&#x60;). Cannot be combined with adSetId or smartPlus. On Meta use POST /v1/ads/create with existingCampaignId. | [optional] |
| **identity_id** | **String** | TikTok only. The identity the ad runs as (the profile shown on the ad), from GET /v1/ads/tiktok-identities. Default: the connected TikTok account&#39;s own identity. Must be authorized on the advertiser or the call fails naming the available ones. | [optional] |
| **identity_type** | **String** | TikTok only. Type of identityId; resolved from the advertiser&#39;s identity list when omitted. | [optional] |
| **budget_amount** | **Float** | Budget in whole currency units, the same flat field as POST /v1/ads/create. Required unless adSetId is set. Minimum varies: TikTok&#x3D;$20, Pinterest&#x3D;$5, others&#x3D;$1 | [optional] |
| **budget_type** | **String** | Goes together with budgetAmount. lifetime requires schedule.endDate. | [optional] |
| **budget** | [**BoostPostRequestBudget**](BoostPostRequestBudget.md) |  | [optional] |
| **instagram_account_id** | **String** | Meta only. Instagram identity the ad runs AS (creative.instagram_user_id), overriding the account linked to the Page. Live-verified against a Page-post creative. | [optional] |
| **destination_type** | **String** | Meta only. Ad-set destination_type: where the click LANDS, as opposed to instagramAccountId which is who the ad runs as. Independent of plain link CTAs and their goal. A messaging callToAction selects its destination automatically; an explicit destinationType must then match. Lead ads use ON_AD. | [optional] |
| **whatsapp_phone_number** | **String** | Meta WhatsApp only. E.164 number already paired with the Page. Omit to use the default pairing. Requires WHATSAPP_MESSAGE callToAction. Stored as creative.whatsappPhoneNumber on the ad. | [optional] |
| **currency** | **String** | ISO 4217 currency code matching the ad account&#39;s currency. Meta only. Optional: Zernio resolves it from the ad account when omitted. The value selects the minor-unit exponent Zernio converts budget/bid amounts by before calling Meta (most currencies are cents; zero-decimal currencies like JPY/KRW are sent as-is). | [optional] |
| **start_date** | **Time** | Ad-set start time (ISO 8601, e.g. \&quot;2026-06-10T09:00:00Z\&quot;), mapped to the ad set&#39;s &#x60;start_time&#x60;. When omitted the ad starts delivering immediately. Same field as on POST /v1/ads/create. | [optional] |
| **end_date** | **Time** | Ad-set end time (ISO 8601), mapped to the ad set&#39;s &#x60;end_time&#x60;. Required for lifetime budgets. Same field as on POST /v1/ads/create. | [optional] |
| **schedule** | [**BoostPostRequestSchedule**](BoostPostRequestSchedule.md) |  | [optional] |
| **targeting** | [**BoostPostRequestTargeting**](BoostPostRequestTargeting.md) |  | [optional] |
| **location_targeting_type** | [**GoogleLocationTargetingType**](GoogleLocationTargetingType.md) | Google only (400 elsewhere). Written on the campaign the boost creates. | [optional] |
| **raw_targeting** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Meta only. A Meta-native targeting spec (e.g. &#x60;{ \&quot;geo_locations\&quot;: { \&quot;cities\&quot;: [{ \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;...\&quot;, \&quot;radius\&quot;: 15, \&quot;distance_unit\&quot;: \&quot;kilometer\&quot; }] } }&#x60;). Sent alone it is forwarded unchanged. Use for advanced fields the structured object does not expose (flexible_spec, excluded audiences, business places, user_os, wireless_carrier).  Can be combined with &#x60;targeting&#x60;: rawTargeting is the BASE layer and the built camelCase spec is merged on top, key by key (camelCase wins on collision). The merge goes one level deep inside &#x60;geo_locations&#x60; and &#x60;excluded_geo_locations&#x60; (built sub-keys win; raw-only sub-keys such as &#x60;location_types&#x60; survive). Array values (&#x60;flexible_spec&#x60;, ...) are replaced as a whole key, never element-merged.  When &#x60;rawTargeting&#x60; is present the &#x60;advantage_audience: 0&#x60; default that Zernio normally applies is no longer emitted, so it cannot clobber a &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60; sent in the raw spec. Meta requires &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60; on ad set creation, so include it in the raw spec, or send &#x60;targeting.advantage_audience&#x60; (0 or 1), which is merged over raw as &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **bid_strategy** | [**BidStrategy**](BidStrategy.md) | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Meta bid strategy applied to the ad set. On TikTok, mapped to &#x60;bid_type&#x60; / &#x60;bid_price&#x60; / &#x60;deep_bid_type&#x60; automatically.  | [optional] |
| **bid_amount** | **Float** | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Bid cap in WHOLE currency units (USD: 5 &#x3D; $5.00; JPY: 100 &#x3D; ¥100). Required when &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP&#x60; or &#x60;COST_CAP&#x60;. Backward-compat: providing &#x60;bidAmount&#x60; without &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is treated as &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **roas_average_floor** | **Float** | Deprecated: send it inside &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; instead (Meta today; TikTok&#39;s nested shape is planned). The flat field keeps working during the deprecation window; sending both shapes returns a 400.  Minimum ROAS as a decimal multiplier (e.g. 2.0 &#x3D; 2.0x ROAS). Required when &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS&#x60;. Sent to Meta as &#x60;bid_constraints.roas_average_floor&#x60; × 10000 (Meta uses fixed-point integers).  | [optional] |
| **platform_specific_data** | [**BoostPostRequestPlatformSpecificData**](BoostPostRequestPlatformSpecificData.md) |  | [optional] |
| **tracking** | [**BoostPostRequestTracking**](BoostPostRequestTracking.md) |  | [optional] |
| **special_ad_categories** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Meta only. Required for housing, employment, credit, or political ads. | [optional] |
| **special_ad_category_country** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Meta (metaads) only. 2-letter ISO country codes the special ad category applies to. Requires specialAdCategories to be set (400 otherwise). | [optional] |
| **regional_regulated_categories** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Meta only. Regional regulation categories required when the ad set targets certain countries (e.g. BRAZIL_REGULATION, SINGAPORE_UNIVERSAL, TAIWAN_UNIVERSAL, THAILAND_UNIVERSAL, AUSTRALIA_FINSERV, INDIA_FINSERV, TAIWAN_FINSERV). Forwarded to the ad set. | [optional] |
| **regional_regulation_identities** | **Hash&lt;String, Integer&gt;** | Meta only. Beneficiary/payer entity IDs for regionalRegulatedCategories. Values are numeric IDs from Meta verification. Keys vary by category (e.g. universal_beneficiary / universal_payer for BRAZIL_REGULATION and THAILAND_UNIVERSAL). If omitted, Meta uses Ads Manager defaults when configured. | [optional] |
| **link_url** | **String** | Website URL for non-messaging CTA buttons. Send it with &#x60;callToAction&#x60;. Omit for messaging boosts.  **Meta**: adds a top-level &#x60;call_to_action&#x60; to the post-reference creative. This is what gives a &#x60;traffic&#x60; boost a clickable destination without replacing the creative and losing the post&#39;s social proof. Ignored when &#x60;leadGenFormId&#x60; is set, which supplies its own destination. Live-verified against a Page-post creative.  **TikTok**: maps to &#x60;landing_page_url&#x60; on the Spark Ad creative (&#x60;AdcreateCreatives.landing_page_url&#x60;); Spark Ads have no clickable destination without it.  Ignored on LinkedIn / Pinterest / X / Google, which infer the destination from the boosted post.  | [optional] |
| **call_to_action** | **String** | CTA button label. Non-messaging CTAs require &#x60;linkUrl&#x60;. WHATSAPP_MESSAGE, MESSAGE_PAGE, and INSTAGRAM_MESSAGE do not require a URL and reject linkUrl.  **Meta**: the CTA enum of POST /v1/ads/create plus &#x60;VIEW_INSTAGRAM_PROFILE&#x60;, &#x60;WHATSAPP_MESSAGE&#x60;, &#x60;MESSAGE_PAGE&#x60;, and &#x60;INSTAGRAM_MESSAGE&#x60;. VIEW_INSTAGRAM_PROFILE requires linkUrl; the messaging CTAs select their destination automatically.  **TikTok**: pass-through to &#x60;call_to_action&#x60; on the Spark Ad creative; the platform validates the value. See TikTok&#39;s \&quot;Enumeration - Call-to-Action\&quot;.  | [optional] |
| **spark_auth_code** | **String** | TikTok-only. Spark Code (creator&#39;s &#x60;auth_code&#x60;) authorizing cross-creator Spark Ads: the advertiser can boost a video owned by a DIFFERENT TikTok account. Without this, boosts are limited to videos owned by the same account running the ads (same-BC creators only). The creator generates the code in their TikTok app&#39;s Promote settings and shares it with the advertiser. Maps to &#x60;auth_code&#x60; on the creative entry of /v2/ad/create/.  | [optional] |
| **smart_plus** | **Boolean** | TikTok only. Run the Spark post in a Smart+ campaign (goal &#x60;conversions&#x60; &#x3D; Smart+ Web Conversions, &#x60;lead_generation&#x60; &#x3D; Smart+ Lead Generation) instead of a regular campaign. Requires &#x60;sparkAuthCode&#x60; (the Smart+ ad runs the post under the identity that redeeming its Spark code creates; a Business Center-owned post is not accepted there) and &#x60;promotedObject.pixelId&#x60; + &#x60;customEventType&#x60;. &#x60;app_promotion&#x60; is not available on a Spark post. Rejected with a 400 on other platforms. A Smart+ Spark ad uses a dynamic CTA portfolio, sent as ad_configuration.call_to_action_id (TikTok does not accept a named call to action there): Zernio creates one per ad account and reuses it, and &#x60;callToAction&#x60; is rejected with a 400 on this path. | [optional] |
| **spark_posts** | [**Array&lt;BoostPostRequestSparkPostsInner&gt;**](BoostPostRequestSparkPostsInner.md) | TikTok Smart+ only (requires &#x60;smartPlus: true&#x60;). Several Spark posts as creatives of ONE Smart+ ad, each with its own post code (TikTok allows 1-50 per ad; posts from different creators mix). Replaces &#x60;platformPostId&#x60; + &#x60;sparkAuthCode&#x60;. Without &#x60;adSetId&#x60; it creates campaign + ad group + one ad carrying all of them; with &#x60;adSetId&#x60; it creates one new ad with all of them in that ad group. Rejected with a 400 on other platforms. | [optional] |
| **promo_codes** | [**Array&lt;BoostPostRequestPromoCodesInner&gt;**](BoostPostRequestPromoCodesInner.md) | TikTok Smart+ Web Conversions only (requires &#x60;smartPlus: true&#x60;, goal &#x60;conversions&#x60;). Promo codes or offers TikTok highlights on the ad (Ads Manager&#39;s \&quot;Add promo code or offer\&quot;). A promo code needs shoppers to enter it at checkout; an entry without &#x60;promoCode&#x60; is an offer applied automatically. Rejected with a 400 on other platforms and on Lead Generation campaigns. | [optional] |
| **promoted_object** | [**BoostPostRequestPromotedObject**](BoostPostRequestPromotedObject.md) |  | [optional] |
| **dsa_beneficiary** | **String** | Legal entity that benefits from the ad. Required when targeting EU users (EU DSA, Article 26). Optional if the ad account has a default beneficiary: set it once via &#x60;PATCH /v1/ads/accounts&#x60; or in Meta Ads Manager, and Meta fills it in whenever the field is omitted.  | [optional] |
| **dsa_payor** | **String** | Legal entity that pays for the ad. Can differ from &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60; (for example, an agency paying for a client&#39;s ads). Same rules as &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60;: required for EU targeting unless the ad account has a default payor.  | [optional] |
| **lead_gen_form_id** | **String** | Lead Gen form ID to attach to the boosted ad&#39;s creative. REQUIRED when &#x60;goal&#x60; is &#x60;lead_generation&#x60;. On Meta this is the leadgen_forms ID (create one via POST /v1/ads/lead-forms). On LinkedIn this is the adForm ID (create one via POST /v1/ads/lead-forms with a LinkedIn account); the creative&#39;s &#x60;leadgenCallToAction.destination&#x60; is set to &#x60;urn:li:adForm:{id}&#x60;. Ignored for other goals. | [optional] |
| **status** | **String** | Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Google. Publish state of the created entities. Omitted or ACTIVE publishes live (default); PAUSED creates them paused so you can review before they spend. On Meta a new campaign stays paused until explicitly activated; an attached ad is itself paused. On Google the pause is held on the campaign the boost creates (ad group and ad switched on), so PUT /v1/ads/campaigns/{campaignId}/status with &#x60;active&#x60; brings it live. On LinkedIn the whole campaign group, campaign, and creative hierarchy stays PAUSED (intendedStatus PAUSED on each). | [optional] |
| **budget_level** | **String** | Meta only, same semantics as POST /v1/ads/create: campaign &#x3D; Advantage campaign budget (CBO), the budget and bid strategy sit on the campaign and the ad set inherits them. Default adset. Not allowed with adSetId. | [optional] |
| **attribution_spec** | [**Array&lt;BoostPostRequestAttributionSpecInner&gt;**](BoostPostRequestAttributionSpecInner.md) | Meta only. Ad-set attribution windows, same shape as POST /v1/ads/create. Applied on OUTCOME_SALES, OUTCOME_LEADS and OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION campaigns (conversions, lead_conversion, lead_generation, app_promotion); other objectives keep Meta&#39;s default. Not allowed with adSetId. | [optional] |
| **bodies** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Meta only. Extra primary-text options Meta rotates on the boosted post (asset_feed_spec.bodies with DEGREES_OF_FREEDOM); the post keeps its own text as one of the options. Works for Facebook posts and Instagram media. Under a conversions or traffic goal Meta also wants a website URL on the options, taken from &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; (send it with a &#x60;callToAction&#x60;); engagement boosts need none. | [optional] |
| **optimization_goal** | **String** | Meta, or TikTok with &#x60;goal: video_views&#x60;. TikTok: ENGAGED_VIEW (6-second Focused View, the default) or ENGAGED_VIEW_FIFTEEN (15-second views), both billed per view (CPV); any other value is a 400. Meta: explicit ad-set &#x60;optimization_goal&#x60; override. When omitted, defaults to the value derived from &#x60;goal&#x60;. Messaging boosts always use CONVERSATIONS and reject another optimizationGoal. Otherwise the value must be compatible with the objective Meta derives from &#x60;goal&#x60;, not with the objective used by &#x60;POST /v1/ads/create&#x60; for the same &#x60;goal&#x60; name: boost maps &#x60;goal: \&quot;engagement\&quot;&#x60; to objective &#x60;OUTCOME_AWARENESS&#x60;, which accepts &#x60;REACH&#x60;, &#x60;IMPRESSIONS&#x60;, &#x60;AD_RECALL_LIFT&#x60;, or THRUPLAY-class values, and rejects &#x60;POST_ENGAGEMENT&#x60; (that value is only valid under &#x60;OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT&#x60;, which create uses for the same goal name).  | [optional] |
