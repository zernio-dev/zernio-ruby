# Zernio::UpdateAccountRequestXCapabilities

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **analytics** | **Boolean** | Enable periodic analytics reads (impressions, likes, etc.) for this X account. Each X API call is metered as &#x60;posts_read&#x60; and billed pass-through (~$0.005/call at the time of writing — actual rate depends on X&#39;s pricing tier).  | [optional] |
| **inbox** | **Boolean** | Enable DM polling and inbox sync for this X account. DM reads are metered as &#x60;dm_event_read&#x60; (~$0.010/call) and DM sends as &#x60;dm_interaction_create&#x60; (~$0.015/call), both billed pass-through. DM sends fire only on user-initiated actions; reads/polling fire only when this flag is true.  | [optional] |

require 'zernio-sdk'
