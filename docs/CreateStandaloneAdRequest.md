## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **account_id** | **String** |  |  |
| **ad_account_id** | **String** |  |  |
| **name** | **String** |  |  |
| **campaign_name** | **String** | Meta only. Exact campaign name. Overrides the default &#x60;&lt;name&gt; - Campaign&#x60;. | [optional] |
| **ad_set_name** | **String** | Meta only. Exact ad set name. Overrides the default &#x60;&lt;name&gt; - Ad Set&#x60;. (For per-ad names on the multi-creative shape, set &#x60;name&#x60; on each &#x60;creatives[]&#x60; entry.) | [optional] |
| **ad_name** | **String** | Meta only. Exact ad name (the single-creative ad object&#39;s name). Overrides the default, which is &#x60;name&#x60;. (For per-ad names on the multi-creative shape, set &#x60;name&#x60; on each &#x60;creatives[]&#x60; entry instead.) | [optional] |
| **tracking** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestTracking**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestTracking.md) |  | [optional] |
| **goal** | **String** | Required on legacy and multi-creative shapes; the attach shape inherits it from the ad set. Available goals vary by platform.  **Meta** - &#x60;conversions&#x60;: OUTCOME_SALES. Requires &#x60;promotedObject.pixelId&#x60; and &#x60;promotedObject.customEventType&#x60; with a commerce event such as PURCHASE or START_TRIAL. - &#x60;lead_conversion&#x60;: OUTCOME_LEADS optimizing website pixel leads. Same pixel and event fields, but with a leads-class event such as LEAD, SUBMIT_APPLICATION, SCHEDULE or CONTACT. Meta gates conversion events by objective, so leads-class events are rejected under &#x60;conversions&#x60;. - &#x60;lead_generation&#x60;: OUTCOME_LEADS with instant forms. Requires &#x60;leadGenFormId&#x60;. &#x60;promotedObject.pageId&#x60; is optional and auto-filled from the connected Page. - &#x60;app_promotion&#x60;: requires &#x60;promotedObject.applicationId&#x60; and &#x60;promotedObject.objectStoreUrl&#x60;. - &#x60;catalog_sales&#x60;: Advantage+ catalog ads, for example vehicle inventory. Requires &#x60;promotedObject.productSetId&#x60;, &#x60;promotedObject.pixelId&#x60; and &#x60;promotedObject.customEventType&#x60;. Builds a catalog TEMPLATE creative from the copy fields, which may carry template tags like {{product.name}} or {{vehicle.make}}. No imageUrl or video is sent; Meta renders the visuals per catalog item. Discover catalogs via GET /v1/ads/catalogs and product sets via GET /v1/ads/catalogs/{catalogId}/product-sets. Single shape only, no creatives[], adSetId, dynamicCreative or placementAssets.  **TikTok** - &#x60;conversions&#x60;: website-conversion ad group. Requires &#x60;promotedObject.pixelId&#x60;, your TikTok Pixel ID. Accepts an optional &#x60;promotedObject.customEventType&#x60; with a TikTok optimization_event code your pixel tracks (newer pixels use e.g. SHOPPING for purchase events; legacy pixels use ON_WEB_ORDER, INITIATE_ORDER, ON_WEB_REGISTER or FORM). To inherit pixel and event from an existing ad group, pass &#x60;adSetId&#x60; instead.  **LinkedIn** - &#x60;engagement&#x60;, &#x60;traffic&#x60;, &#x60;awareness&#x60; and &#x60;video_views&#x60; create standalone Direct Sponsored Content ads. &#x60;traffic&#x60; requires &#x60;linkUrl&#x60;; &#x60;video_views&#x60; requires &#x60;video&#x60;. - &#x60;job_applicants&#x60; requires a &#x60;platformSpecificData.jobs&#x60; creative. - For &#x60;lead_generation&#x60; or &#x60;conversions&#x60; on LinkedIn, or to promote an existing post, use POST /v1/ads/boost.  | [optional] |
| **optimization_goal** | **String** | Meta only. Explicit ad-set &#x60;optimization_goal&#x60; (e.g. &#x60;LANDING_PAGE_VIEWS&#x60;, &#x60;LINK_CLICKS&#x60;, &#x60;REACH&#x60;, &#x60;IMPRESSIONS&#x60;, &#x60;OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS&#x60;, &#x60;THRUPLAY&#x60;, &#x60;LEAD_GENERATION&#x60;). Overrides the default derived from &#x60;goal&#x60; (e.g. &#x60;traffic&#x60; defaults to &#x60;LINK_CLICKS&#x60;). Forwarded verbatim to Meta, which validates compatibility with the campaign objective and rejects incompatible combinations. | [optional] |
| **billing_event** | **String** | Meta only. Explicit ad-set &#x60;billing_event&#x60;. Defaults to &#x60;IMPRESSIONS&#x60;. Forwarded verbatim to Meta, which validates compatibility with the optimization goal. | [optional] |
| **budget_amount** | **Float** | Required on legacy + multi-creative shapes. Inherited on attach. | [optional] |
| **budget_type** | **String** | Required on legacy + multi-creative shapes. Inherited on attach. | [optional] |
| **status** | **String** | Meta only. Publish state of the created ad set + ad. Omitted or ACTIVE publishes live (default, back-compat); PAUSED creates them paused and skips activation, so you can review before they spend. | [optional] |
| **budget_level** | **String** | Meta only. Where the budget lives, which selects the Meta budget model:   - &#x60;adset&#x60; (default): ABO (Ad-set Budget Optimization). The budget is set on the     ad set. This is the back-compatible behaviour — omit this field to keep it.   - &#x60;campaign&#x60;: CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization / Advantage Campaign Budget). The     budget AND &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; are set on the CAMPAIGN, and Meta distributes spend     across ad sets automatically. Meta requires the budget at exactly one level, never both. Non-Meta platforms ignore this field. Ignored on the attach shape (&#x60;adSetId&#x60;), which inherits the existing budget.  | [optional][default to &#39;adset&#39;] |
| **currency** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **headline** | **String** | Required for Meta, Google, Pinterest, and LinkedIn on legacy + attach shapes (skip for multi-creative — use &#x60;creatives[].headline&#x60;). Ignored for TikTok and X/Twitter. Max: Meta&#x3D;255, Google&#x3D;30, Pinterest&#x3D;100, LinkedIn&#x3D;400. On LinkedIn this is the ad&#39;s headline (the bold text on the creative); for traffic ads it&#39;s the link card title. | [optional] |
| **long_headline** | **String** | Google Display only — defaults to &#x60;headline&#x60; if omitted. On LinkedIn, reused as the optional secondary description text on traffic (link) ads; omitted if not provided. | [optional] |
| **body** | **String** | Required on legacy + attach shapes. For X/Twitter this is the tweet text (max 280 chars including a ~24-char URL when &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; is set). On LinkedIn this is the post commentary (the intro text shown above the ad). Max: Google&#x3D;90, Pinterest&#x3D;500. | [optional] |
| **description** | **String** | Meta only (facebook/instagram). Link description — the secondary text shown below the headline (Meta&#39;s link_data.description; on video creatives mapped to video_data.link_description). When omitted, Meta auto-pulls the destination URL&#39;s OpenGraph description. Applies on legacy, attach, and placementAssets shapes; for multi-creative use creatives[].description (this field is the shared fallback). For multi-text variations use dynamicCreative.descriptions instead. | [optional] |
| **call_to_action** | **String** | Required on legacy + attach shapes for Meta. Honoured on TikTok (passes through to the Spark Ad creative&#39;s &#x60;call_to_action&#x60;) and on LinkedIn (the CTA button on the ad; defaults to LEARN_MORE when &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; is set). LinkedIn accepts: LEARN_MORE, SIGN_UP, DOWNLOAD, SUBSCRIBE, REGISTER, JOIN, ATTEND, REQUEST_DEMO, VIEW_QUOTE, APPLY, SEE_MORE, SHOP_NOW, BUY_NOW. Ignored by Google, Pinterest, and X/Twitter. | [optional] |
| **link_url** | **String** | Required on legacy + attach shapes (skip for multi-creative). On LinkedIn it&#39;s the ad&#39;s destination URL; required for &#x60;traffic&#x60; ads, optional for &#x60;engagement&#x60; / &#x60;awareness&#x60;. NOT required when &#x60;goal&#x60; is &#x60;lead_generation&#x60; (the ad opens a Lead Gen form instead of a destination). On LinkedIn, &#x60;imageUrl&#x60; + &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; publishes an ARTICLE-content creative; this is LinkedIn&#39;s article ad format, with the image as thumbnail and &#x60;longHeadline&#x60; as description. | [optional] |
| **lead_gen_form_id** | **String** | Meta Lead Gen forms only (facebook/instagram). The leadgen_forms ID to attach to the ad&#39;s creative — create one via POST /v1/ads/lead-forms. REQUIRED when &#x60;goal&#x60; is &#x60;lead_generation&#x60;, and on every ATTACH (&#x60;adSetId&#x60;) call that targets a lead ad set (the form attaches per-ad; Meta rejects a formless ad in a lead ad set). Ignored otherwise. The ad set&#39;s promoted_object.page_id + LEAD_GENERATION optimization + destination_type ON_AD are derived automatically from the goal. Both &#x60;placementAssets&#x60; (per-placement creative) and &#x60;dynamicCreative&#x60; (multi-text / multi-asset pool, e.g. multiple headlines and primary texts) ARE supported on instant-form lead ads — the form is attached for you, and for &#x60;dynamicCreative&#x60; the ad set is created as a Dynamic Creative ad set automatically (Meta requires that for any multi-text feed; there is no non-DCO multi-text path). Send a single &#x60;imageUrls&#x60; entry plus your text variations to get Meta&#39;s \&quot;Multiple Text Options\&quot; behavior on a lead ad. | [optional] |
| **image_url** | **String** | Image creative for Meta/Google/Pinterest/LinkedIn on legacy + attach shapes (mutually exclusive with &#x60;video&#x60;). Required for LinkedIn ads unless &#x60;video&#x60; is set. Not required for Google Search campaigns. For TikTok, this field carries the VIDEO URL (the TikTok ads endpoint is video-only; the field retains the &#x60;imageUrl&#x60; name for cross-platform consistency). Ignored for X/Twitter. For Google Display, treated as the landscape image (alias of &#x60;images.landscape&#x60;); supply &#x60;images.square&#x60; alongside or the request is rejected. For LinkedIn the image is uploaded to LinkedIn under the authoring Company Page (see &#x60;organizationId&#x60;); recommended ratio 1.91:1 (e.g. 1200×627). | [optional] |
| **images** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestImages**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestImages.md) |  | [optional] |
| **video** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestVideo**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestVideo.md) |  | [optional] |
| **creatives** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestCreativesInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestCreativesInner.md) | Meta-only. When present, switches to the multi-creative shape: creates 1 campaign + 1 ad set + N ads (one per entry here). Top-level &#x60;headline&#x60; / &#x60;body&#x60; / &#x60;imageUrl&#x60; / &#x60;linkUrl&#x60; / &#x60;callToAction&#x60; are ignored in this mode. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;adSetId&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **ad_set_id** | **String** | Meta-only. When present, switches to the attach shape: adds one new ad to this existing ad set without creating a new campaign. Budget, targeting, goal, schedule, AND bid strategy are inherited from the ad set on Meta — passing &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; in attach mode returns 400. To change an existing ad set&#39;s bid, use &#x60;PUT /v1/ads/ad-sets/{adSetId}&#x60;. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;creatives[]&#x60;.  The attached ad takes the full single-creative surface: &#x60;headline&#x60;/&#x60;body&#x60;/&#x60;description&#x60;/&#x60;callToAction&#x60; plus either &#x60;imageUrl&#x60;/&#x60;video&#x60; OR &#x60;placementAssets&#x60; (its own per-placement Feed/Story assets), and &#x60;leadGenFormId&#x60; when the target is a lead ad set (the parent must be ON_AD — true for ad sets created via goal &#x60;lead_generation&#x60;; Meta rejects a formless ad there, so pass the form on EVERY attached ad). This is the way to build N full ads sharing one ad set: create the first ad via the normal shape, then attach the rest one call each.  Supported on Meta (facebook, instagram), TikTok, and LinkedIn. On TikTok the &#x60;adSetId&#x60; is the ad group ID; the new ad inherits the ad group&#39;s bid + budget + targeting. On LinkedIn the &#x60;adSetId&#x60; is the LinkedIn Campaign ID (numeric); we attach a new Creative to that Campaign, so the Campaign&#39;s &#x60;platformSpecificData&#x60; bidding, targeting, budget and schedule are inherited (passing those fields returns 400).  | [optional] |
| **existing_campaign_id** | **String** | Meta + LinkedIn. On Meta: add the new ad set under this EXISTING campaign instead of creating a new one (multi-ad-set audience testing). The new ad set&#39;s budget is matched to the campaign&#39;s mode automatically: for a CBO campaign (campaign-level budget) omit &#x60;budgetAmount&#x60;/&#x60;budgetType&#x60; — the campaign owns the budget; for an ABO campaign pass them (they go on the new ad set). On LinkedIn: create a new Campaign (and its Creative) under this EXISTING CampaignGroup. On failure only the entities we authored are cleaned up; the pre-existing parent is left untouched and is never (re)activated. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;adSetId&#x60; and &#x60;creatives[]&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **existing_creative_id** | **String** | Meta only. Reuse an EXISTING ad creative by id instead of building a new one from the copy/media fields (which are then ignored). Combine with &#x60;existingCampaignId&#x60; to build a multi-ad-set campaign that shares one creative. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;creatives[]&#x60;, &#x60;dynamicCreative&#x60;, and &#x60;placementAssets&#x60;. The creative id used is returned as &#x60;creativeId&#x60; on the create response.  | [optional] |
| **business_name** | **String** | Google Display only | [optional] |
| **board_id** | **String** | Pinterest only. Board ID (auto-creates if not provided). | [optional] |
| **organization_id** | **String** | LinkedIn only. The Company Page that authors the Direct Sponsored Content (\&quot;dark\&quot;) post backing the ad — accepts a numeric organization ID or a full &#x60;urn:li:organization:N&#x60; URN. Required unless the resolved &#x60;accountId&#x60; is a connected LinkedIn Company-Page account (defaults to that page) or the LinkedIn ad account is org-owned (defaults to the account&#39;s owning organization). The authenticated member must be an ADMINISTRATOR or DIRECT_SPONSORED_CONTENT_POSTER of this page (and the page must be associated with the ad account), or LinkedIn returns 403. Ignored by every other platform. | [optional] |
| **countries** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (e.g. [&#39;NL&#39;]). Defaults to [&#39;US&#39;] when no &#x60;cities&#x60; or &#x60;regions&#x60; are provided. (LinkedIn currently honours country-level targeting only.) | [optional] |
| **cities** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestCitiesInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestCitiesInner.md) | Meta-only. City-level geo targeting. Each city is targeted by Meta&#39;s opaque &#x60;key&#x60; (the city ID) which can be looked up via &#x60;GET /v1/ads/targeting/search?type&#x3D;city&amp;q&#x3D;&lt;name&gt;&amp;country_code&#x3D;&lt;ISO&gt;&#x60;. Optional &#x60;radius&#x60; + &#x60;distance_unit&#x60; extend the targeting beyond the city limits (e.g. radius 25 km around the city center). Both must be set together, or both omitted (Meta defaults to ~16 km when omitted).  Cannot overlap with the same country in &#x60;countries&#x60; (Meta returns a \&quot;locations overlap\&quot; error). Either drop the country or scope it to a different country.  | [optional] |
| **regions** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestRegionsInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestRegionsInner.md) | Meta-only. Region-level (state/province) geo targeting. Each region is targeted by Meta&#39;s opaque &#x60;key&#x60; (the region ID) which can be looked up via &#x60;GET /v1/ads/targeting/search?type&#x3D;region&amp;q&#x3D;&lt;name&gt;&amp;country_code&#x3D;&lt;ISO&gt;&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **age_min** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **age_max** | **Integer** |  | [optional] |
| **interests** | [**Array&lt;UpdateAdRequestTargetingInterestsInner&gt;**](UpdateAdRequestTargetingInterestsInner.md) | Interest objects from /v1/ads/interests. Each must include id and name. | [optional] |
| **zips** | [**Array&lt;BoostPostRequestTargetingRegionsInner&gt;**](BoostPostRequestTargetingRegionsInner.md) | Postal/ZIP geo targeting. &#x60;key&#x60; is the platform&#39;s postal location ID from /v1/ads/targeting/search?dimension&#x3D;geo&amp;geoType&#x3D;zip. Supported on Meta, Google, TikTok, Pinterest, X. | [optional] |
| **metros** | [**Array&lt;BoostPostRequestTargetingRegionsInner&gt;**](BoostPostRequestTargetingRegionsInner.md) | DMA / metro-area geo targeting. &#x60;key&#x60; is the platform&#39;s metro ID from /v1/ads/targeting/search?dimension&#x3D;geo&amp;geoType&#x3D;metro. | [optional] |
| **custom_locations** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestCustomLocationsInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestCustomLocationsInner.md) | Point-radius (lat/lng) geo targeting. Meta only (custom_locations). Rejected on platforms without radius support. | [optional] |
| **behaviors** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestBehaviorsInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestBehaviorsInner.md) | Behaviour entities from /v1/ads/targeting/search?dimension&#x3D;behavior. Supported on Meta and TikTok. Each must include id. | [optional] |
| **income_tier** | **String** | Normalized household-income tier. Meta and TikTok express all four; Google maps only &#x60;top_10&#x60;; rejected on LinkedIn, X, and Pinterest. On Meta, income targeting is incompatible with housing/employment/credit &#x60;specialAdCategories&#x60;.  | [optional] |
| **languages** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Language codes restricting the audience by language. On Meta, ISO 639-1 codes (e.g. [&#39;en&#39;], [&#39;de&#39;]); a bare code targets all regional variants (\&quot;en\&quot; &#x3D; all English), or use a region-qualified code for a specific one (\&quot;en_GB\&quot;, \&quot;pt_BR\&quot;, \&quot;zh_TW\&quot;). Unknown codes are rejected. Other ad platforms use their own language-code systems. | [optional] |
| **placements** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestPlacements**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestPlacements.md) |  | [optional] |
| **saved_targeting_id** | **String** | ID of a &#x60;saved_targeting&#x60; audience (created via POST /v1/ads/audiences). When set, its stored TargetingSpec is expanded as the base targeting; inline fields on this body merge on top. Lets you reuse a named targeting preset without re-sending every field.  | [optional] |
| **raw_targeting** | **Hash&lt;String, Object&gt;** | Meta only. A raw Meta-native targeting spec passed to the ad set VERBATIM (snake_case: &#x60;geo_locations&#x60;, &#x60;age_min&#x60;, &#x60;excluded_custom_audiences&#x60;, &#x60;flexible_spec&#x60;, &#x60;targeting_automation&#x60;, business places, etc.) — exactly the shape &#x60;GET /v1/ads/{adId}&#x60; returns for external ads. Use it to clone a campaign&#39;s targeting EXACTLY, preserving advanced fields the camelCase targeting fields can&#39;t model. Mutually exclusive with the camelCase targeting fields (countries/regions/cities/interests/ ageMin/...), &#x60;audienceId&#x60;, and &#x60;savedTargetingId&#x60; (sending both → 422). Sent as-is; Meta validates and surfaces any errors. If cloning an EU campaign, also pass &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60; / &#x60;dsaPayor&#x60; (those are separate fields, not part of targeting).  | [optional] |
| **special_ad_categories** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Meta only. Declares the ad&#39;s special category, required for housing, employment, credit, or political/social-issue ads (Meta enforces restricted targeting for these). Note: setting a special category disables income/zip targeting on Meta.  | [optional] |
| **end_date** | **Time** | Required for lifetime budgets | [optional] |
| **start_date** | **Time** | Meta only. Ad-set start time (ISO 8601, e.g. \&quot;2026-06-10T09:00:00Z\&quot;), mapped to the ad set&#39;s &#x60;start_time&#x60;. When omitted the ad starts delivering immediately. For lifetime budgets Meta also requires &#x60;endDate&#x60;. (Same &#x60;schedule.startDate&#x60; semantics already available on &#x60;POST /v1/ads/boost&#x60;.)  | [optional] |
| **instagram_account_id** | **String** | Meta only. Override the Instagram account the ad is delivered as — pass an Instagram Business Account ID (e.g. 17841...), mapped to the creative&#39;s &#x60;instagram_user_id&#x60;. When omitted we auto-resolve the IG account linked to the connected Facebook Page (the existing default). Useful when a Page has more than one eligible IG account.  | [optional] |
| **dynamic_creative** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestDynamicCreative**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestDynamicCreative.md) |  | [optional] |
| **placement_assets** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestPlacementAssets**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestPlacementAssets.md) |  | [optional] |

| **advantage_audience** | **Integer** | Meta only. Controls the Advantage audience feature (targeting_automation). 0 &#x3D; disabled (default), 1 &#x3D; enabled. Meta Marketing API requires this field on all ad set creation requests. | [optional] |
| **attribution_spec** | [**Array&lt;CreateStandaloneAdRequestAttributionSpecInner&gt;**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestAttributionSpecInner.md) | Meta only. Conversion attribution window for the ad set — maps 1:1 to Meta&#39;s ad-set &#x60;attribution_spec&#x60;. Only honored for conversion goals (&#x60;conversions&#x60;, &#x60;lead_generation&#x60;, &#x60;app_promotion&#x60;); ignored for awareness/traffic/engagement. Omit to use Meta&#39;s default (&#x60;7-day click&#x60; + &#x60;1-day view&#x60;). Meta enforces the valid combinations: &#x60;VIEW_THROUGH&#x60; only allows &#x60;windowDays: 1&#x60; (7d/28d view windows were removed Jan 2026); &#x60;ENGAGED_VIDEO_VIEW&#x60; only &#x60;1&#x60; and only alongside &#x60;VIEW_THROUGH: 1&#x60;; &#x60;CLICK_THROUGH: 28&#x60; only on certain objectives. Invalid combos surface as a Meta 400. Example: &#x60;[{ \&quot;eventType\&quot;: \&quot;CLICK_THROUGH\&quot;, \&quot;windowDays\&quot;: 7 }, { \&quot;eventType\&quot;: \&quot;VIEW_THROUGH\&quot;, \&quot;windowDays\&quot;: 1 }]&#x60;  | [optional] |
| **gender** | **String** | Meta only. Restrict the audience by gender. &#39;male&#39; targets men only, &#39;female&#39; targets women only, &#39;all&#39; (default) targets everyone. Ignored by non-Meta platforms. | [optional][default to &#39;all&#39;] |

| **roas_average_floor** | **Float** | Minimum ROAS as a decimal multiplier (e.g. 2.0 &#x3D; 2.0x ROAS). Required when &#x60;bidStrategy&#x60; is &#x60;LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS&#x60;. Sent to Meta as &#x60;bid_constraints.roas_average_floor&#x60; × 10000.  | [optional] |
| **platform_specific_data** | [**LinkedInAdsPlatformData**](LinkedInAdsPlatformData.md) |  | [optional] |
| **dsa_beneficiary** | **String** | Legal entity that benefits from the ad. Required when targeting EU users (EU DSA, Article 26). Optional if the ad account has a default beneficiary: set it once via &#x60;PATCH /v1/ads/accounts&#x60; or in Meta Ads Manager, and Meta fills it in whenever the field is omitted.  | [optional] |
| **dsa_payor** | **String** | Legal entity that pays for the ad. Can differ from &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60; (for example, an agency paying for a client&#39;s ads). Same rules as &#x60;dsaBeneficiary&#x60;: required for EU targeting unless the ad account has a default payor.  | [optional] |
| **brand_identity** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestBrandIdentity**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestBrandIdentity.md) |  | [optional] |

Requires a connected TikTok posting account     on the same profile.   - &#x60;CUSTOMIZED_USER&#x60;: synthetic Brand Identity (display     name + avatar). Requires a configured Brand Identity     (cached on the &#x60;tiktokads&#x60; SocialAccount via     &#x60;PATCH /v1/connect/tiktok-ads&#x60;) or an inline     &#x60;brandIdentity&#x60; to create one on the fly.  When omitted, defaults to &#x60;TT_USER&#x60; if a posting account is connected on this profile, else &#x60;CUSTOMIZED_USER&#x60;. Spark Ads (&#x60;POST /v1/ads/boost&#x60;) always use &#x60;TT_USER&#x60; regardless of this field — TikTok requires the original organic post&#39;s author identity for Spark.  | [optional] |
| **promoted_object** | [**CreateStandaloneAdRequestPromotedObject**](CreateStandaloneAdRequestPromotedObject.md) |  | [optional] |
