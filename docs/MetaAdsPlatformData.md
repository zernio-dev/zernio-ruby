# Zernio::MetaAdsPlatformData

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **bid_strategy** | [**BidStrategy**](BidStrategy.md) |  | [optional] |
| **bid_amount** | **Float** | Whole currency units (USD: 5 &#x3D; $5.00). Required when bidStrategy is LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP or COST_CAP. May also be sent alone, WITHOUT bidStrategy, to set the cap on an ad set joining a COST_CAP / LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP campaign (the strategy is inherited from the campaign). On POST /v1/ads/create that shape requires existingCampaignId and is a 400 otherwise; on POST /v1/ads/boost it is promoted to LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP. | [optional] |
| **roas_average_floor** | **Float** | Decimal ROAS multiplier (2.0 &#x3D; 2.0x). Required when bidStrategy is LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS; sending it without bidStrategy is a 400. | [optional] |
| **daily_min_spend_target** | **Float** | Meta daily_min_spend_target on the ad set being created: the least it should spend per day, in whole currency units. It reserves a share of a CAMPAIGN budget, so it requires budgetLevel campaign or an existingCampaignId whose campaign has the budget (Advantage campaign budget / CBO); with an ad-set budget it is a 400, because Meta rejects a spend limit on an ad set that owns its budget. A target, not a guarantee. Mutually exclusive with lifetimeMinSpendTarget: the flavour must match the campaign budget type. Rejected with 400 on POST /v1/ads/boost and in adSetId attach mode: use PUT /v1/ads/ad-sets/{adSetId} for an ad set that already exists. | [optional] |
| **lifetime_min_spend_target** | **Float** | Meta lifetime_min_spend_target: the lifetime-budget flavour of dailyMinSpendTarget, in whole currency units. Same rules and same rejections. | [optional] |
