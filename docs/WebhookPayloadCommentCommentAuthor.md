Populated on the Instagram and Facebook realtime webhooks (Meta re-delivers the account&#39;s own replies as comments events) and on TikTok, where it is inferred: comments created through this API are always flagged, and once the account&#39;s own author identifier is known (from one of those or from a comments listing) every author is compared against it. Absent means not evaluated, never \&quot;not the account\&quot;. | [optional] |
