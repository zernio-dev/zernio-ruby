# Zernio::WebhookPayloadMessageMessageAttachmentsInner

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **type** | **String** | Attachment type (image, video, file, sticker, audio, share).  Instagram and Facebook deliver a shared reel, post or ad with no type of its own (Meta&#39;s &#x60;unsupported_type&#x60;). Zernio resolves it from the media&#39;s Content-Type at ingest, so it arrives as &#x60;image&#x60;, &#x60;video&#x60;, &#x60;audio&#x60; or &#x60;file&#x60; with &#x60;originalType: \&quot;unsupported_type\&quot;&#x60;. &#x60;type: \&quot;unsupported_type\&quot;&#x60; itself is emitted only when the CDN could not be classified in time; the &#x60;url&#x60; still works.  |  |
| **original_type** | **String** | Instagram and Facebook only, and present only when it differs from &#x60;type&#x60;. Meta&#39;s own attachment type before Zernio normalized it: &#x60;ig_reel&#x60; and &#x60;reel&#x60; become &#x60;video&#x60;, while &#x60;ig_post&#x60;, &#x60;post&#x60;, &#x60;ig_story&#x60; and &#x60;story_mention&#x60; all become &#x60;share&#x60;.  Read it before rendering, because &#x60;type: \&quot;share\&quot;&#x60; alone is ambiguous. In particular a story mention arrives as &#x60;type: \&quot;share\&quot;&#x60; with &#x60;originalType: \&quot;story_mention\&quot;&#x60;; treating an unrecognized type as a generic document shows your agent \&quot;document received\&quot; for what is usually a lead.  &#x60;originalType: \&quot;unsupported_type\&quot;&#x60; marks a share Meta did not classify, resolved by content type. **Download it on receipt**: Meta answers &#x60;is_unsupported&#x60; with no attachments when the message node is read back, so the attachment-resolve endpoint cannot re-mint this url once it expires.  | [optional] |
| **mime_type** | **String** | MIME type of the media when Zernio knows it. On Instagram and Facebook it is set for shares resolved by content type (&#x60;originalType: \&quot;unsupported_type\&quot;&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **url** | **String** | Where to fetch the attachment. **The contract differs by platform.**  - **WhatsApp**: points at &#x60;GET /v1/whatsapp/media/{mediaId}&#x60;, an   authenticated Zernio endpoint. You MUST send   &#x60;Authorization: Bearer &lt;your API key&gt;&#x60;; fetching it without that   header returns &#x60;401&#x60;. Download and store the bytes when this   webhook arrives: Meta drops inbound media after a limited   retention window, after which the endpoint answers &#x60;400&#x60;   permanently and the media is unrecoverable. - **Instagram / Facebook / Telegram**: a direct platform CDN link   that needs no authentication and expires on the platform&#39;s own   schedule.  **Webhook attachments carry no &#x60;refreshUrl&#x60;.** That field is stamped only when you read a message back over REST (&#x60;GET /v1/inbox/conversations/{conversationId}/messages&#x60;). On Instagram and Facebook the url above is a signed Meta CDN link that expires, so do not persist it: store the message id and resolve the media through &#x60;GET /v1/inbox/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}/attachments/{index}?accountId&#x3D;{accountId}&#x60;, which re-mints it on demand. Every value that URL needs is already in this payload: &#x60;message.conversationId&#x60;, &#x60;message.platformMessageId&#x60;, &#x60;account.accountId&#x60;, and the attachment&#39;s zero-based position in this array.  |  |
| **payload** | **Object** | Additional attachment metadata | [optional] |
