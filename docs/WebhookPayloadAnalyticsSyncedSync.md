# Zernio::WebhookPayloadAnalyticsSyncedSync

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **synced_at** | **Time** | When the cycle COMPLETED. Not a join key for the delta feed: the rows a cycle produces carry a &#x60;syncedAt&#x60; stamped when the cycle STARTED, which is measured at around one second earlier at the median and up to a couple of minutes earlier in the tail. Correlate on &#x60;account.accountId&#x60;.  |  |
| **posts_updated** | **Integer** | Post records created or modified by this cycle. Not the number of delta feed rows the cycle produced, which the syncer does not report, so a cycle with a non-zero &#x60;postsUpdated&#x60; can still yield an empty delta page.  |  |

## Example

```ruby
require 'zernio-sdk'

instance = Zernio::WebhookPayloadAnalyticsSyncedSync.new(
  synced_at: null,
  posts_updated: 42
)
```
