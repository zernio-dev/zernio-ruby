# Zernio::ConversionDestination

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **id** | **String** | Platform-native identifier. Pass back as &#x60;destinationId&#x60; on event send and as the path segment on CRUD endpoints.  |  |
| **name** | **String** |  |  |
| **type** | **String** | Present when the platform locks the event type/category to the destination (Google conversion actions, LinkedIn conversion rules). Absent for Meta pixels (which accept any event name per request).  | [optional] |
| **status** | **String** | For LinkedIn, &#x60;inactive&#x60; means the rule is soft-deleted (&#x60;enabled: false&#x60;).  | [optional] |
| **ad_account_id** | **String** | Set by adapters whose destinations are scoped to a specific ad account (LinkedIn). Pass back on subsequent CRUD calls to identify the parent ad account.  | [optional] |
