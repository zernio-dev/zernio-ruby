# Zernio::SendInboxMessage200ResponseData

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **message_id** | **String** | Platform id of the sent message (not returned for Reddit). For WhatsApp this is the raw Meta wamid, the same id delivered as message.platformMessageId on webhooks and delivery-status updates, and the value to pass as replyTo to quote-reply. | [optional] |
| **conversation_id** | **String** | Zernio conversation id, echoed so the thread can be read back or replied to. It equals the id the list-conversations endpoint returns for Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS and Slack; for Facebook, Instagram, Bluesky and Reddit that endpoint returns the platform thread id instead, so do not correlate the two by equality. For X (Twitter), when the request addressed the conversation by its Twitter dm_conversation_id, that platform id is echoed back instead. Omitted when the send succeeded but the conversation could not be resolved to a stored record. | [optional] |
| **attachments** | [**Array&lt;SendInboxMessage200ResponseDataAttachmentsInner&gt;**](SendInboxMessage200ResponseDataAttachmentsInner.md) | Echo of the sent attachment with its resolved public URL, when one is available (Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp). | [optional] |
| **message_ids** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Facebook/Instagram only. Present when an attachment and text were both requested: Meta has no single body shape for both, so the send is two Meta messages under the hood. First element &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; messageId (the attachment); second is the follow-up text. | [optional] |
| **partial_failure** | [**SendInboxMessage200ResponseDataPartialFailure**](SendInboxMessage200ResponseDataPartialFailure.md) |  | [optional] |
