# Zernio::BlueskyPlatformData

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **langs** | **Array&lt;String&gt;** | Language(s) of the post text as 1-3 BCP-47 codes (e.g. \&quot;pt\&quot;, \&quot;en-US\&quot;), written to the post record&#39;s langs field. Bluesky feed generators filter on this field, so posts without it never appear in language-scoped feeds. Can only be set at creation (Bluesky has no post editing). When threadItems is used, every item in the thread carries the same langs. When omitted, the account&#39;s default (set via PATCH /v1/accounts/{accountId}/bluesky-settings) applies; with no default either, the field is absent from the record.  | [optional] |
| **thread_items** | [**Array&lt;TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner&gt;**](TwitterPlatformDataThreadItemsInner.md) | Complete sequence of posts in a Bluesky thread. The first item becomes the root post, subsequent items are chained as replies. When threadItems is provided, the top-level content field is used only for display and search purposes, it is NOT published. You must include your first post as threadItems[0].  | [optional] |

## Example

```ruby
require 'zernio-sdk'

instance = Zernio::BlueskyPlatformData.new(
  langs: [pt, en],
  thread_items: null
)
```
